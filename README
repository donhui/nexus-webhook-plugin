Nexus WebHook Plugin
https://github.com/vbehar/nexus-webhook-plugin

This is a Nexus plugin that provides WebHook notifications when new (Maven) artifacts are stored in a Nexus instance.
Basically it POST an HTTP request to one or more urls, with the details of the event as a JSON document in the request body.
See http://www.webhooks.org/ for more information about WebHooks.

Usage
- Register your WebHook urls in the configuration file. See https://github.com/vbehar/nexus-webhook-plugin/blob/master/webhooks.properties for a sample with instructions.
- If you want to reload your configuration, do an HTTP (GET or POST) request to "http://NEXUS_HOST/service/local/webhooks/configuration/reload" (or restart Nexus...)
- If you want to test your WebHook listeners, you can send a fake event by doing an HTTP (GET or POST) request to "http://NEXUS_HOST/service/local/webhooks/fakeEvent?r=releases&g=com.example&a=webapp&v=2.1.0&c=&e=war"
  of course you can change the r(epository), g(roupId), a(rtifactId), v(ersion), c(lassifier) and e(extension) parameters...
- Finally, release some artifacts in Nexus and wait for your listeners be notified and do their work ;-)
